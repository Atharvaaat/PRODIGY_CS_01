# Prodigy Infotech Task Solutions

This repository serves as a comprehensive solution hub for the tasks assigned during my tenure as a Cybersecurity Intern at Prodigy Infotech. Each task is meticulously implemented using cutting-edge technologies and best practices to demonstrate proficiency in web development and cybersecurity principles.

## Task 1: Implement Caesar Cipher

### Overview
Caesar Cipher is a classical encryption technique that shifts the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of positions. The task involved implementing this cipher algorithm using modern web technologies.

### Implementation
- **HTML Interface:** Developed an intuitive HTML interface (`caesarcipher.html`) for user interaction.
- **Styling with CSS:** Applied aesthetically pleasing CSS styles to enhance the user experience and interface.
- **JavaScript Logic:** Implemented the Caesar Cipher algorithm in JavaScript to handle encryption and decryption seamlessly.

## Task 2: Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption

### Overview
This task demanded the implementation of advanced pixel manipulation techniques in JavaScript to encrypt and decrypt images efficiently.

### Implementation
- **HTML Interface:** Crafted a user-friendly HTML interface (`image_encryption.html`) allowing users to upload images and visualize the encryption process.
- **Styling with CSS:** Utilized CSS for creating visually appealing layouts and responsive design elements.
- **JavaScript Algorithms:** This task required implementing pixel manipulation techniques in JavaScript to encrypt and decrypt images. The encryption involved performing bitwise XOR operations on the RGB values of each pixel. Engineered robust JavaScript algorithms to manipulate image pixels using the HTML5 Canvas API, ensuring secure encryption and decryption of images.

## Task 3: Password Complexity Checker

### Overview
The Password Complexity Checker task necessitated the creation of a robust solution to evaluate the strength of passwords based on various criteria.

### Implementation
- **HTML Structure:** Designed a clean and intuitive HTML structure (`password_checker.html`) to facilitate user input and display strength metrics.
- **CSS Styling:** Employed CSS styling to enhance the visual aesthetics and user experience of the password complexity checker interface.
- **Dynamic JavaScript:** Developed dynamic JavaScript functions to analyze password strength, provide real-time feedback, and suggest improvements based on predefined criteria.

## Task 4: Simple Keylogger

### Overview
The Simple Keylogger task involved creating a lightweight keylogger application to capture user keystrokes and log them securely.

### Implementation
- **HTML Interface:** Designed an intuitive HTML interface (`keylogger.html`) with user input and output text areas, along with intuitive control buttons.
- **CSS Styling:** Styled the HTML elements using CSS to ensure a visually appealing and professional user interface.
- **Efficient JavaScript Logic:** Implemented efficient JavaScript logic to capture user keystrokes, start/stop logging, and facilitate log saving functionalities seamlessly.
